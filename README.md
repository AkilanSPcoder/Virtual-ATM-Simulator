This is a simple Virtual ATM Simulator written in C. The program allows a user to log in using a 16-digit account number and PIN. After logging in, the user can check balance, withdraw money, deposit money, and view a mini statement that stores the last five transactions. All transactions and receipts are saved automatically in a file called transactions.txt. The project uses basic C concepts such as structures, functions, file handling, input validation, and time/date functions. You can compile the code using gcc main.c -o atm and run it with ./atm. The program includes four sample accounts with predefined PINs and balances, and you can edit or add accounts directly inside the code. This project is useful for beginners learning C programming and understanding how ATM systems work in a simple way.
